Wordpress Plugin: RSS Signature

Please visit http://www.smackfoo.com/plugins/sig2feed/ for more details.

Sig2feed's primary goal is to provide a simple administration interface
to allow the addition of a custom tag, signature or copyright message to 
the wordpress generated rss feeds. 

You can add any kind of message, tag, or even images. Cool huh?
