This plugin is a Syntax Hiliter for various programming/scripting
languages.
I know that there is already a syntax highlighter plugin available at
http://scott.yang.id.au/2004/05/syntax-hilight-enscript/
but I had problems with that plugin, it didn't work on my Windows machine as
it requires GNU Enscript which I think is only available for Unix/Linux. So I
thought of making this plugin. This plugin uses GeSHi(v1.0.7.6) for
hiliting the code. You can find GeSHi at http://qbnz.com/highlighter/

If you haven't already, then you might want to checkout the official
announcement of this plugin at
http://blog.igeek.info/still-fresh/2006/02/25/code-for-fun/
for more stuff that I might've missed out in the MANUAL & here(I doubt
that I missed any though).

I'm also aware of other syntax hiliting plugins(for WP) & copycats
which use GeSHi for colourising the code, but then the original thing is
ORIGINAL afterall, copycats will always be behind as they copy, they are
not innovative. As I know of it, none of the other plugins(at the time of
writing this) are as easy to use or as feature packed as this plugin, be it
that they CLAIM to have just few lines of code(anyone heard of 15 line
plugin??).

Its you who have to decide, whether you want a 15 line plugin
with no feature except it returns un-controlled colourised code and which
doesn't implement the GeSHi engine well, or you want a 400+ line powerhouse
with all sorts of features & ease of use that none other offers!!


Read the accompanying MANUAL for installation/upgrade/usage instructions
and other important stuff.
